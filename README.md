# Welcome to Classically Punk

## Task
The problem addressed in this project is the classification of audio files based on their genre using machine learning techniques. The challenge lies in accurately identifying and classifying different genres of music based on audio features.
The data used in this project can be downloaded using this <a href = "https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/classically_punk_music_genres.tar.gz">link</a>

## Description
To solve this problem, various feature extraction methods such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were explored. Different classification models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, were implemented and evaluated for their performance in genre classification. After thorough experimentation, a Neural Network model was found to be the best-performing, achieving an accuracy of 81%.

## Installation
To use this project, there are some libraries you will need to install first before use.
To install them, you can use the "pip install" keyword. Below are the frameworks used in this project.
Librosa

IPython

Os

Numpy

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Sklearn

Tensorflow

## Usage
To use this project: Run the preprocessed audio data through the trained Neural Network model for genre classification.
The model will output the predicted genre for each audio file.
Evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model based on the predicted genre labels.

<b>Note:</b> Please note that the coding for this project was performed on Google Colab due to the large size of the data and the utilization of a neural network model. Therefore you will need to upload the data into your google drive to use it.
